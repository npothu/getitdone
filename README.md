**AI-Powered Productivity Optimization Based on Menstrual Cycle Phases - HACK GT 2025**

*Revolutionizing productivity by aligning work with natural hormonal rhythms*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

getitdone is the first productivity platform that uses multi-agent AI to optimize task scheduling based on menstrual cycle phases. By understanding the cognitive and energy patterns throughout the hormonal cycle, we help women maximize their productivity while reducing guilt and stress around natural biological fluctuations.

### The Problem
- 73% of women report productivity guilt during certain cycle phases
- Traditional productivity apps ignore biological rhythms
- Women consistently underperform against male-designed productivity standards
- Academic and workplace environments don't accommodate natural hormonal variation

### Our Solution
An intelligent platform that:
- **Predicts optimal task timing** using cycle-aware AI agents
- **Reduces productivity guilt** by reframing timing as optimization
- **Maximizes cognitive performance** by aligning tasks with hormonal strengths
- **Provides cycle education** to improve self-awareness and planning
